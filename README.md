# RORProcessPriority

These registry entries allow you to set Return of Reckoning's process priority permanently. I was inspired to make these .reg files because I was annoyed with slideshow ORvR and wanted to maximise performance as much as possible. I also knew of a collection of similar .reg files for Fortnite and decided to edit it to work for Return of Reckoning. This is better because now I don't have to use Task Manager every time.

For streamers, I recommend using the High Priority file and setting your streaming program's priority to Above Normal. For everyone else, use the High Priority file in case something else is running at above normal priority. To revert to normal, use the Normal file.

Installation instructions:
Click "Code" (the green button), "Download ZIP", extract the file you need and double click it.
